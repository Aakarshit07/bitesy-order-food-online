# [🍕 Bitesy](https://bitesy.vercel.app/) 

[Bitesy](https://bitesy.vercel.app/) is an online food ordering web app inspired by [Swiggy](https://www.swiggy.com/city/bangalore/). Swiggy has been a staple for my food ordering needs, providing a seamless experience. However, I felt I could customize and enhance certain aspects to better suit my preferences. Thus, I embarked on building this project for both learning and personal use.
